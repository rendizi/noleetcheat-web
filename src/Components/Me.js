                I started grinding LeetCode last summer (2023) and felt bad because I couldn't solve some problems. In the hope that I would understand anything, I just copied others' solutions and asked ChatGPT for help. And yeah, not gonna lie, it helped me a little—I had a 24-day streak. But now I want to change something—to become better at algorithms and grind harder. So I just created this simple browser extension that could help me, and maybe you. And no, at the moment, I haven't stopped googling—I just avoid direct solutions for problems. I'm not sure if I should post it in the Chrome store. If you'd like to see it there, let me know. Happy coding!
